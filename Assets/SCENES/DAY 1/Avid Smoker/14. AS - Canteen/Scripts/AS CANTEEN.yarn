Melissa:So Davide, how was your Redcross service yesterday?
Melissa:Did you get to enjoy the consert?
Davide:It was actually really nice!
Davide:We got lucky because nobody needed any help so we got to listen and enjoy the consert
Davide:I would have never said that i like clasical music
Tom:You don't understand how lucky you are!
Tom:Do you even realise how important that event is?
->Davide:Well, I’m not really a classical music guy, hehehe.
->Davide: Honestly, I didn’t know it was such a big deal until people started telling me after the concert.
->Davide: Lucky, huh? I guess it’s one of those things where being in the right place at the right time works out.

Tom:I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT TO GO TO THE SPRING SYMPHONY GALA!
Narrator: Tom's face was a mix of envy and disbelief.
Tom:Do you even know how exclusive that event is? People wait years to get tickets!
Melissa:It's not like Davide planned it. He was just doing his Red Cross duties.
Tom:But still! The Vienna Philharmonic! 
Tom:Live! I’ve been dreaming of this since I was a kid!
Tom:And you… you just stumble into it?
->Davide: Well, I guess volunteering has its perks, huh? Maybe you should join next time.
->Davide: Hey, I didn’t make the rules. They just told us where to be, and there we were.
->Davide: I feel bad rubbing it in, but yeah, it was pretty amazing.

Melissa: Alright, enough. What about you, Tom? What amazing thing did you do yesterday?
Tom:Oh, nothing as glamorous as attending a world-class concert, that's for sure.
Tom:Just finished some boring project work.
Melissa: Boring, huh? You don’t usually downplay your achievements. Spill it.
Tom:Okay, fine.
Tom:I may have landed a freelance gig with one of the top graphic design firms in the city. But no big deal.
->Davide:No big deal? That’s amazing, Tom!
     Tom: Thanks, Davide. It’s been a lot of hard work, but I’m really excited to see where it goes.
->Davide:Well, if that’s boring to you, I’d love to see what you think is exciting hahahahahah
     Tom:Alright, fair point. I guess I just get caught up in the details sometimes.
->Davide: Yeah, sure, we’re all very impressed by your "boring" project. Must be nice to be humble and successful at the same time.
     Tom:Alright, alright, I get it. No need to rub it in, Davide.
