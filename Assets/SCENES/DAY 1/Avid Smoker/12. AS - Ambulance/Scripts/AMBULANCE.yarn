Bryan:Alright, we’ll loop around the park first
Bryan:The event looks pretty packed already
Bryan:Keep your eyes open for anyone who might need help.

Max:A lot of families. Good vibes, though
Max:Let’s hope it stays that way!

->Davide:You know, this might actually be a quiet night for once. Famous last words, right?
    Max:Oh, you just cursed us, man. Get ready for chaos.
->Davide:Quiet? Nah, this is just the calm before the storm. I give it 10 minutes before something happens.
    Max:Don’t jinx it, man!
->Davide:Come on, you know quiet nights are boring. Bring on the drama!
    Max:You’re gonna regret saying that when we’re running all night.

Bryan:If anything happens, it’s on you, Davide
Max:Just has said...
Dave:Someone’s waving. Near the fountain

Bryan:Good catch!
Bryan:Max, hit the lights. Let’s check it out!

Narrator:Max flicked on the ambulance lights, and Bryan pulled over near the fountain
