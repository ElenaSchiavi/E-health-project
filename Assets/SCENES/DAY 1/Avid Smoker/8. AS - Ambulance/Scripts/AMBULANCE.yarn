//DA RIVEDERE

Narrator: The team was now in the ambulance, cruising through the streets as they patrolled the downtown area. The faint hum of the engine filled the quiet moments between their conversations.

Bryan: glancing at the GPS Alright, we’ll loop around the park first. The event looks pretty packed already. Keep your eyes open for anyone who might need help.

Max: peering out the window A lot of families. Good vibes, though. Let’s hope it stays that way.

Davide: leaning back in his seat You know, this might actually be a quiet night for once. Famous last words, right?

Max: laughs Oh, you just cursed us, man. Get ready for chaos.

Bryan: grins If anything happens, it’s on you, Davide.

Dave: quietly, looking out the window Someone’s waving. Near the fountain.

Bryan: quickly turning to look Good catch. Max, hit the lights. Let’s check it out.

Narrator: Max flicked on the ambulance lights, and Bryan pulled over near the fountain. A man holding a small child waved frantically as the team stepped out.

Man: panicked My daughter fell and hit her head. She’s been crying non-stop, and I’m worried!

Bryan: Alright, sir, stay calm. We’ll take a look. Max, grab the kit. Davide, check her vitals.

Davide: kneeling by the child Hey there, sweetheart. It’s okay, we’re here to help. Can you tell me your name?

Child: sniffles Lily...

Davide: Alright, Lily. I’m Davide. Let me just take a quick look, okay? gently checks her head

Narrator: While Davide worked, Max handed over supplies, and Bryan kept the man reassured. Dave stood nearby, keeping an eye on the surrounding crowd.

Bryan: She’s in good hands, sir. Let’s just give them a moment.

Davide: standing up She’s got a bump, but nothing serious. Just keep an eye on her, and if she gets dizzy or feels sick later, take her to the hospital.

Man: relieved Thank you so much. Really, thank you.

Max: grinning No problem. Just doing our job.

Narrator: The team returned to the ambulance, the tension easing as they prepared to continue their patrol.

Davide: with a chuckle See? Calm night. Told you.

Max: laughs You’re lucky that wasn’t worse.

Bryan: Alright, let’s keep moving. Who knows what’s next?

Narrator: With that, the ambulance rolled back into the night, ready for whatever might come their way.
